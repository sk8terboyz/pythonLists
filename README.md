## Python Lists

This code was created for a class I took where all code was developed on Linux servers.

This code was developed to fulfill homework requirements, not professional development.

Initially these files were called hw3-1.py and hw3-2.py, but I renamed them to pairSum.py and reverse.py respectively.

Previous README (typically used to explain the program to peers or answer questions asked by the professor):

hw3-1.py (pairSum.py)
This program will both output the given test data by the assignment, and accept user inputted data.
The given test data will be outputted with both the original and calculated arrays (indicated in the output).
Then it will prompt the user asking if they would like to enter in their own data.
The user will need to enter 'y' if they wish to enter in their own data.
When there is user inputted data, it will ask for the number of elements they want to place in an array.
They the user will enter in each element one-by-one.
The process cannot be terminated once started, and will only accept integer inputs, as string inputs would not work with addition.
Run this program with the following command: python hw3-1.py

hw3-2.py (reverse.py)
This program will do both, output the intended test data, and take user input for a different array.
After the program outputs the original test arrays and their reversed order, it will ask if you want to input your own array.
If you do wish to input your own array, enter 'y' and then it will ask how many elements you wish to enter into the new array.
Then you will be able to just enter in the values, one-by-one.
After each element, just press enter and input the next element.
The program will continue waiting for input values until the array is filled based on the size you entered earlier.
Run this program with the following command: python hw3-2.py
